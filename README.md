# MyAPMS

This repository contains a backend API service built with Node.js and Express, intended to demonstrate backend architecture, API design, and cloud deployment practices.

The application exposes RESTful endpoints, handles background processing through scheduled cron jobs, and is structured to support maintainability, scalability, and clean separation of concerns. It is deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and reflects production-oriented backend patterns rather than product-specific logic.
